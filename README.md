Staged Formal + Simulation Hand‑Off
===================================

This repo documents a two-stage verification flow that chains a formal proof to a replayed trace and then launches a second proof from the baked-in state. The walkthrough in ``docs/source/index.rst`` explains the method, sharp edges, and a working req/ack example you can reproduce with SymbiYosys.
